# HTML
This is practice for using HTML only as I have not yet learned to style it using CSS.
I have created a sample and also used the website https://htmleditor.w3schools.in to see the output of my efforts.
I had to remove the information that was already in the website and replace it with my own.
The first file I added is practicehtml and it is just a first attempt to see if my code would work in the htmleditor mentioned above.
The second file I added is practicehtmlcss and was added after learning a little CSS. 
I used the editor to see if the css that i added would work.
Both files worked with some tweeking and I am tickled pink, even if they are plain. 
I am learning and that makes me happy.
